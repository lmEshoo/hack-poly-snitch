The inspiration behind our code happened when we were attempting to register for our class that was just added. When we received the email that a new class had opened up by the time we obtained access to a computer the class had already filled up. So we decided to create a device that would immediately tell you when a new class has been added to the schools website. We were able to create a mock website and create a device that detected whenever the website changed.
